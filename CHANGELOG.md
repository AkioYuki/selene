# Changelog

## 0.0.7
- fixed python3 support
- fixed the is_displayed method - now it cotains implicit wait for "exist in DOM" instead of "visible"
- added ss(".element", of=Task) syntax in addition to ss(".element").of(Task)
- removed "general interceptor of all unknown methods" SElement's base class (actually commented it in code:)
- refactored lazy inner collection classes to use extend in __init__ and not use SElementsCollectionWrapper (removed the latter and SElementWrapper)
- refactored: removed unnecessary extend from "inner" selement collections (it is needed obviously only for "inner" selement collection element classes)

## 0.0.6 (released 22.02.2016)
- added alias methods:
```
    insist_not = assure_not
    should_not = assure_not
    should_not_be = assure_not
    should_not_have = assure_not
```
- removed stopit from dependencies
- optimized element actions (now they wait for visibility only if first try failed)
  - now selene is as fast as selenium with research of elements before any action. Manual cashing is also available when "raw selenium" speed is needed (semi-automatic customizable cashing will be added later)
- optimized SElementsCollection#find implementation - now it returns first match, not filter everything and then get first among all matches
- mapped all webelement methods to selement (almost all) - now autocompletion works fully for selement
- optimized logic of "inner lazy elements" of collection, removed a bit of magic from it.

## 0.0.5 (released 20.02.2016)

- big refactoring
  - removed currently unstable things
    - automatic driver management (Firefox)
        - so now management is manual but you can use any driver you want (Firefox, Chrome, etc...)
    - screenshooting
  - removed "too complicated" things
    - automatic Loading of widgets
      - so now no any difference between insist, assure, should
  - added aliases (maybe too much... some may be marked as deprecated in future)
    - insist, assure, should, should_be, should_have
    - find more in elements.py, etc.
  - added more overloaded element methods... removed some magic in implementation, still needed to simplify more...
  - added tests, still not enough though
  - added support of other locators (in addition to css)
